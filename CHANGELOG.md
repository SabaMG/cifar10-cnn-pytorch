## [v2.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- Deep CNN architecture with **6 convolutional layers** for improved performance.
- Improved data augmentation: random horizontal flip + random crop with padding.
- Layer normalization retained with BatchNorm after each convolution.
- Dropout (0.3) applied before fully connected layer for regularization.
- TensorBoard logs extended to include the deeper model training.
- Updated `README.md` with new architecture, logs and final performance.

### Changed
- `model.py`: upgraded architecture to 6 conv layers.
- `dataset.py`: updated transforms to stronger augmentations.
- `main.py`: maintained training script with same optimizer and scheduler.

### ğŸ“Š Performance
- âœ… Final test accuracy: **87.43%**
- âœ… Model: Deep CNN (6 conv layers, ReLU, MaxPooling, BatchNorm, Dropout)
