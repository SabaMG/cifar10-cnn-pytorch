## [v1.0] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- Initial training pipeline for CIFAR-10 classification using a basic CNN.
- Modular project structure with `model.py`, `train.py`, `dataset.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `main.py`.
- Support for `AdamW` optimizer and learning rate scheduling (`StepLR`).
- Label smoothing loss with `nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)`.
- TensorBoard logging: loss, accuracy, learning rate, weight histograms.
- Best model saving to `best_model.pth` and automatic loading after training.
- MPS support for Apple Silicon (`config.device`).
- Early stopping mechanism.
- Seed reproducibility and multi-seed support.
- Project README.md with usage instructions.
- `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` prepared for clean environments.

### ğŸ“Š Performance
- âœ… Final test accuracy: **81.43%**
- âœ… Model: CNN with 3 convolutional layers, kernel 3Ã—3, ReLU, MaxPooling.

---

## ğŸ”œ Planned (v2.0+)
- Deeper CNN (4+ conv layers).
- ResNet-18 backbone integration.
- WideResNet-28-10 for state-of-the-art performance.
- Improved data augmentation (Cutout, ColorJitter, etc.).
- Learning rate warmup and cosine decay.
